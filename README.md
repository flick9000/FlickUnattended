# Flick's Autoattend Preset

Here is my autoattend.xml preset that incorporates many of the tweaks and configurations discussed [in this guide] This preset is designed for a clean, without telemetry, bloat-free Windows installation that bypasses TPM, skips the internet requirement, creates a local account without a password, applies useful system and Windows Explorer tweaks, and removes unnecessary apps.

## What is included in the preset?

- Bypasses TPM
- Skips the internet requirement
- Creates a local account without a password
- Applies Explorer tweaks such as showing hidden files and extensions, disabling widgets, using the classic right-click menu, and hiding Edge first-run experience.
- Applies system tweaks such as Disabling app suggestions (ads) and preventing Bitlocker's encryption.
- Disables sending diagnostic data, personalized input and location history to Microsoft.
- Runs the 'Strict' preset of [WinScript](https://github.com/flick9000/winscript) (Removes all 3rd-party pre-installed apps, Microsoft's bloatware, disables telemetry and data collection, and applies performance tweaks such as setting services as manual so they won't start unless needed.)

Here is the download link for the preset: [autoattend.xml](https://github.com/WinScript/WinScript/blob/master/autoattend.xml).
